MATERIALS
---------
from Avanti Polar Lipids:

**DOPC**: 
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, as 1g powder

**PEGylated lipids**: 18:1 PEG2000 PE
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-\[methoxy(polyethylene
glycol)-2000\] (ammonium salt), as 100mg powder

**biotinylated lipids**: 18:1 Biotinyl Cap PE
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(cap biotinyl) (sodium
salt), as 25mg powder


Protocol
----

**Prepare the Master Mix (MM)** 

Mix all lipids in the DOPC glass bottle to the following final concentrations:

* 100mg/ml DOPC
* 10mg/ml PEG-2000 DOPE
* 0.5mg/ml biotinylated DOPE


1. Take out all components from the freezer and leave at room
temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This will prevent water
condensation when the vials are opened.

2. Thoroughly clean a 10ml glass pipette.

3. Open the 1g DOPC bottle and add 100mg PEG-2000 DOPE directly into it.
The PEG-2000 DOPE is, conveniently, available as a 100mg vial.

4. Then measure out and add \~5mg biotinylated DOPE.

5. Rinse the glass pipette with chloroform. Add chloroform to the dry lipid mix
to disolve. Mix gently by swirling until all the dry lipid is
dissolved.

6. Seal the bottle with plenty of parafilm and store at -20. Stocks are stable for >6months.

**Preparing lipids for experiments**

1. Rinse a small glass vial with water and 100% ethanol; 

2. Dry with nitrogen, and place it in the vacuum oven for at least 30 minutes.

3. Take the MM out of the freezer and let it come to room temperature to
prevent condensation on opening.

4. Rinse a 1ml Hamilton syringe with chloroform (make sure syringe has a metal plunger!).
 
5. Measure out 200ul of the MM and transfer it to the cleaned glass vial.

6. Slowly evaporate the chloroform with a slow nitrogen stream. Try to
get the lipids to dry in a film across the bottom and sides of the vial. 
Make sure all the chloroform, including pockets caught under the lipid film, is evaporated. You can up the nitrogen
pressure as the chloroform evaporates. Sometimes it is necessary to poke pockets with a pipette tip to release the chloroform/

7. Place the vial under vacuum overnight. It can stay like this for a couple days if necessary.

8. Resuspend the lipids in 2ml lipid buffer at room temperature for at
least an hour up to overnight.

9. Vortex the lipids for 3min.

10. Sonicate using microtip at 35% power. Cycle 15s on and 1min off.
Solution should clarify after 2-5 cycles. Once clear, move on to next step.

11. filter lipids with a 0.22um syringe filter and store lipids at 4C.

**prepared lipids are stable for ~2-4 weeks.**
