Components, from Avanti Polar Lipids:

**DOPC**: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, as 1g powder

**PEGylated lipids**: 18:1 PEG2000 PE

1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-\[methoxy(polyethylene
glycol)-2000\] (ammonium salt), as 100mg powder

**biotinylated lipids**: 18:1 Biotinyl Cap PE

1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(cap biotinyl) (sodium
salt), as 25mg powder

**Prepare the Master Mix (MM)** in the DOPC glass bottle. The final
proportions are:

100mg/ml DOPC

10mg/ml PEG-2000 DOPE

.5mg/ml biotinylated DOPE

Use up the entire 1000mg of the DOPC, so the final volume of chloroform
will be 10ml. This translates to 100mg total PEG-2000 DOPE and 5mg
biotinylated DOPE.

1\) Take out all components from the freezer and leave at room
temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This will prevent water
condensation when the vials are opened.

2\) Thoroughly clean a 10ml glass pipette.

3\) Open the 1g DOPC bottle and add 100mg PEG-2000 DOPE directly into it.
The PEG-2000 DOPE is, conveniently, available as a 100mg vial.

4\) Then measure out and add \~5mg biotinylated PEG.

5\) Rinse the glass pipette with chloroform. Dissolve the dry lipid mix
in 10ml chloroform. Mix gently by swirling until all the dry lipid is
dissolved.

6\) Seal the bottle with plenty of parafilm and store at -20.

1\) **To prepare lipids for experiments**, rinse a small glass vial with
water then alcohol; dry it with nitrogen, and place it in the vacuum
oven for 30 minutes or so.

2\) Take the MM out of the freezer and let it come to room temperature to
prevent condensation on opening.

3\) Rinse a 1ml (or similar) Hamilton syringe (with a metal plunger!)
with chloroform. Then meaure out 200ul of the MM and transfer it to the
cleaned glass vial.

4\) Slowly evaporate the chloroform with a slow nitrogen stream. Try to
get the lipids to dry in a film across the side of the vial, up to a
height of a few cm. Make sure all the chloroform, including pockets
caught under the lipid film, is evaporated. You can up the nitrogen
pressure as the chloroform evaporates.

5\) Place the vial under vacuum overnight. It can stay like this for
several days if necessary.

6\) Resuspend the lipids in 2ml lipid buffer at room temperature for at
least an hour. It can go overnight.

7\) Vortex and sonicate. Ask someone about sonication procedures for
lipids--everyone has a different approach.
