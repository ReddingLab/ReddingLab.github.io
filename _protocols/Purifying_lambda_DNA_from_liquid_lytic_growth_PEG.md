See Lockett, Analytical Biochemistry **185**, 230-234 (1990).

1\) Package phage as described in the Epicentre protocol.

2\) Grow an o/n culture of LE392. Inoculate .4ml culture + .4ml (10mM
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) with a single screened plaque.[^1] Vortex briefly
and incubate at 37°C for 15min.

3\) Add this to 200ml of NZCYM broth (contains MgSO<sub>4</sub>) in a 2L flask
(aeration is important). Grow at 37°C at 125rpm for 4hrs., at which
point culture should be cloudy. Begin monitoring OD<sub>600</sub>: it will shoot
up to above 1, and then drop rapidly. As soon as you reach \~.4, begin
monitoring frequently until OD begins to climb again. This will happen
\~.3, and in less than 8hrs.

Sample course:

| time | OD_600 |
| --- | ----------- |
|  4:00 hrs         | 1.6         |
|  4:35 hrs         | 1.8         |
|  5:00 hrs         | 0.5         |
|  5:30 hrs         | 0.315       |
|  5:45 hrs         | 0.35        | 

4\) Add .5ml chloroform and shake at 80rpm for another 5min.

5\) Transfer to a 200ml glass bottle and add dry NaCl to 1M; incubate on
ice for 10min.

6\) Transfer to 50ml tubes, avoiding chloroform. Centrifuge at 12,000xg
for 10min. to remove cell debris.

7\) Collect supernatant evenly in 50ml tubes and centrifuge again at
12,000xg for 5min. to remove remaining cell debris. Add solid PEG<sub>8000</sub>
(or PEG<sub>6000</sub> or similar) to each (10% w/v); incubate on ice for 30min.

8\) 12,000xg for 15min. to pellet phage. You will not get a pure-phage
pellet, but rather a gunky smear containing cell debris... it's OK,
because the phage is in there. Discard supernatant and spin again for
1min. to remove all the PEG-containing supernatant and concentrate the
pellet.

9\) Resuspend in as low a volume of suspension medium (SM) as possible
and pool in a 15ml Falcon. Aim for about 2.5ml total volume. (Volumes of
added buffers below for 2.5ml; scale up as necessay.)

10\) Add RNase[^2] and DNase[^3] to 20µg/ml and 5µg/ml final
concentrations; incubate at 37°C for 30min.

11\) Add 2.5ml .3M Tris-HCl, EDTA to 100mM, and SDS to 1.25%; incubate 10
min. at 65°C

12\) Add 2.5ml ice-cold 3M potassium acetate (forces SDS and associated
proteins out of solution–will form thick, white gel); incubate on ice
for 10 min.

13\) 8,000xg for 10min.; switch centrifuge temp. to 25°C and save
supernatant

14\) Add 5ml isopropanol; 2min. at rt; 8,000xg for 10min. at rt.

15\) Wash in a few mls 70% ethanol, transfer to an eppendorf and slowly
resuspend in desired volume of Tris or TE.

N.B.: There will be RNA and genomic DNA contamination, but the lambda
DNA will be in relatively high concentration and competent to package. A
.6% agarose gel with a 1/10 dilution of product and 1/15 dilution of NEB
lambda for comparison will give you some idea of how well the
purification worked.

[^1]: Extracting the phage beforehand yields the same results as using a
    plug directly.

[^2]: Comes dry; make a 4mg/ml stock in water. R4875-500mg, Sigma.

[^3]: Use Sigma D5319-2mg. According to J, *via* Luke, other DNases will
    chew up packaged lambda DNA.
