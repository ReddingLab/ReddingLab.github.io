| SM Buffer   | Final Concentration     |
| ---------------------:| -----------------------:|
| Tris-HCl, pH7.5       | 50mM                    |
| NaCl                  | 100 mM                   |
| MgSO4                | 8mM                   |



1. Begin with packaged phage as described in the Epicentre protocol.

2. Grow an overnight culture of LE392 cells. 

3. Inoculate .4ml culture + .4ml (10mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) with a single screened plaque. Vortex briefly and incubate at 37°C for 15min.

4. Add this to 200ml of NZCYM broth (contains MgSO<sub>4</sub>) in a 2L flask
(aeration is important). 

5. Grow at 37°C at 125rpm for 4hrs., at which point culture should be cloudy. Begin monitoring OD<sub>600</sub>. 
The OD will shoot up to above 1, and then drop rapidly. As soon as you reach \~.4, begin monitoring frequently until OD begins to climb again. This will happen
\~.3, and in less than 8hrs total.

    Sample course:

    | time | OD_600 |
    | --- | ----------- |
    |  4:00 hrs         | 1.6         |
    |  4:35 hrs         | 1.8         |
    |  5:00 hrs         | 0.5         |
    |  5:30 hrs         | 0.315       |
    |  5:45 hrs         | 0.35        | 

6.  Add .5ml chloroform and shake at 80rpm for another 5min.

7.  Transfer to a 200ml glass bottle and add dry NaCl to 1M; incubate on
ice for 10min.

8.  Transfer to 50ml tubes, avoiding chloroform. Centrifuge at 12,000xg
for 10min. to remove cell debris.

9.  Collect supernatant evenly in 50ml tubes and centrifuge again at
12,000xg for 5min. to remove remaining cell debris. 

10. Add 10% w/v solid PEG8000 to each tube and incubate on ice for 30min.

11. Spin at 12,000xg for 15min to pellet phage. You will not get a pure-phage
pellet, but rather a gunky smear containing cell debris and phage. Discard supernatant
and spin again at 12,000xg for 1min to remove all the PEG-containing supernatant and concentrate the
pellet.

12. Resuspend in as low a volume of SM buffer as possible and pool in a single  15ml Falcon. 
Aim for about 2.5ml total volume.

13. Add RNase and DNase to 20µg/ml and 5µg/ml final concentrations; incubate at 37°C for 30min.

14. Add Tris-HCl to 150mM, EDTA to 100mM, and SDS to 1.25%; incubate 10 min at 65°C

15. Add 2.5ml ice-cold 3M potassium acetate (forces SDS and associated
proteins out of solution–will form thick, white gel); incubate on ice for 10 min.

16. Spin at 8,000xg for 10min and save supernatant

17. Add 5ml isopropanol and incubate for 5 min at room temperature
 
18. Spin at 8,000xg for 10min at room temperature.

19. Wash by adding a few mls 70% ethanol and spin at 8,000xg for 10min at room temperature.

20. Transfer to a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube and resuspend in desired volume of Tris or TE.


NOTES
-----
Use Sigma D5319-2mg other DNases will chew up packaged lambda DNA.

There will be RNA and genomic DNA contamination, but the lambda
DNA will be in relatively high concentration and competent to package. A
.6% agarose gel with a 1/10 dilution of product and 1/15 dilution of NEB
lambda for comparison will give you some idea of how well the
purification worked.

Extracting the phage beforehand yields the same results as using a plug directly.
