Protocol modified from *Nikon Super Resolution Microscope N-STORM Sample
Preparation Manual* (PDF found at
<http://www.mvi-inc.com/wp-content/uploads/N-STORM+Protocol.pdf>)

*Purpose*: use 2uL/mL to remove free radicals produced by exciting
fluors, which could shear DNA if left in solution

*Materials*:

-   **T50 Buffer** (Cold Spring Harbor) – 10mM Tris-Cl (pH=8.0), 50mM
    NaCl

    -   In practice, using Tris-Cl, pH=7.5 still works

-   **Catalase** – solid (stored @ -20°C)

-   **Glucose Oxidase** – lyophilized powder (stored @ -20°C)

*Overview*:

1)  create stocks of glucose oxidase and catalase

2)  combine to create GLOX solution

3)  incubate at 4°C

4)  centrifuge and remove precipitate

5)  filter and store

*Protocol*:

-   Suspend catalase at 17 mg/mL in T50 buffer with 50% glycerol at 4°C

    -   17mg + 625uL 80% glycerol + 325uL T50 buffer

    -   If using 1x T50 buffer, this will be diluted, but that does not
        seem to affect GLOX

-   Suspend 28mg of Glucose Oxidase in 400uL of T50 buffer at 4°C (vortex)

-   Add 100uL of Catalase solution to re-suspended glucose oxidase
    (500uL total)

-   Incubate at 4°C for 20 minutes (catalase activates glucose oxidase)

-   Spin down precipitate at 14,000 rpm in a table-top centrifuge for 5
    minutes at 4°C

    -   If no pellet is visible after centrifuging: flash-freeze the
        500uL GLOX solution, let thaw, and then centrifuge again to
        pellet precipitate

-   Filter the supernatant with a 0.22um syringe filter

-   Store @ 4°C if using immediately (manual says GLOX is good at 4°C
    for two weeks) flash freeze and store long-term stocks of GLOX at
    -80°C
