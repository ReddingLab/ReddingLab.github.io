| T50 Buffer   | Final Concentration     |
| ---------------------:| -----------------------:|
| Tris-HCl, pH 8-7.5    | 10mM                    |
| NaCl                  | 50 mM                   |


MATERIALS
---------

**Catalase** – solid (stored @ -20°C)

**Glucose Oxidase** – lyophilized powder (stored @ -20°C)

Protocol
----

1. Suspend catalase at 17 mg/mL in T50 buffer + 50% glycerol at 4C

2. Suspend 28mg of Glucose Oxidase in 400uL of T50 buffer at 4C and vortex.

3. Add 100uL of Catalase solution to 400uL of suspended glucose oxidase
   
4. Incubate at 4C for 20 minutes 

5. Spin down precipitate at 14,000 rpm in a table-top centrifuge for 5 minutes at 4C

6. If no pellet is visible after centrifuging: flash-freeze the
        Glucose Oxidase Catalase solution, thaw on ice, and then centrifuge again to
        pellet precipitate

7. Filter the supernatant with a 0.22um syringe filter

8. If using immediately, Store at 4C solution is good for 2 weeks. Long term stocks should be 
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.
