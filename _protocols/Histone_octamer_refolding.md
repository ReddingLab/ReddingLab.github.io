**6-8 KDa cutoff dialysis membranes**  
  _Boil in 1L milliQ water for 5 min and cool to room temperature._

**Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column**

PROTOCOL
--------

\(1) Dissolve each lyophilized histone to a concentration of 2 mg/mL in
unfolding buffer. Pipette up and down to dissolve. Do not vortex.

\(2) Allow unfolding to proceed for at least 30 min at room temperature
and for not more than 3 hrs. (30min – 3 hr)

\(3) Mix the four histones so that the molar ratio of H2A: H2B:H3:H4 is
1.2:1.2:1:1.

A slight excess of H2A and H2B is used to ensure complete octamer
formation. This is because octamer and H2A/H2B dimer can be easily
resolved on the superdex200 column, but the H3/H4 tetramer cannot be
easily resolved from the octamer. (M.W.: H2A – 13,960 Da, H2B – 13,774
Da, H3 – 15,273 Da, H4 – 11,236 Da)

\(4) Adjust the final protein concentration of the mix to 1 mg/ml using
unfolding buffer.

\(5) Dialyze in 6-8 KDa cutoff dialysis bag 3 times against 1 L of
refolding buffer. At least one dialysis should be overnight. The rest
should be at least 2 hours each.

\(6) After final dialysis, spin down sample to remove any precipitated
material. Save the supernatant for loading on the column.

\(7) Concentrate the supernatant to \~200 uL in a Microcon 10. Save
flow-through until the end of the prep.

\(8) The previous evening start equilibrating a Superdex 200 HR 10/30
column with refolding buffer.

\(9) Load the concentrated sample on the column but save some (\~5 uL)
for running on a gel. Run the buffer at 0.5 ml/min and collect 0.5 ml
fractions. For this particular column, the octamer should elute at
between\~ 12-13 mls and the dimer between \~15-16 ml.

\(10) Run peak fractions on a gel and pool bonafide octamer fractions.
Concentrate to greater than 1 mg/mL.

\(11) Determine octamer concentration by SYPRO staining using BSA
standards. Flash freeze in Liq N2 and store at –80 ^o^C.
