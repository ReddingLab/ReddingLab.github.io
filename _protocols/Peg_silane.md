*Materials*:

-   **2% Hellmanex** 
-   **1N NaOH** 
-   **PEG-Silane** â€“ Dissolved in 95% ethanol at concentration of 10-50mg/mL

**NOTE** PEG-Silane is light sensitive, so keep in the dark.


__Protocol:__
1. Wash 3x with milliQ water.
2. Soak slides or wells with 2% hellmanex for 1 hour.
3. Wash 3x with milliQ water.
4. Soak slides in 1N NaOH for 30 minutes.
5. Wash 3x with milliQ.
6. _if using slides_ Plasma clean 

7**a**.  If using cover slip and slide, pipette ~50-100uLs of PEG-silane solution onto slide and cover with cover slip. Let incubate in empty tip box with water in bottom overnight _(helps prevent solution from evaporating)_.   
7**b**.  If using plate format, pipette 20-50 uLs into each well, cover with parafilm, and let incubate overnight.

8. rinse slide or wells with ethanol to remove excess peg-silane
9. Wash 3x with millQ.

10**a**. Dry slides: If cover slip and slide, remember which slide was peg coated, and dry in oven or with nitrogen glass. Store covered at -20C. 
10**b**. Dry slides: If plate, pipette out water and bang it on a kim wipe a few times. Then dry with nitrogen and let sit under hood for 1h. Cover with foil tape and
