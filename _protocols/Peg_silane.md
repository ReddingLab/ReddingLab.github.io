*Materials*:

-   **2% Hellmanex** 
-   **1N NaOH** 
-   **PEG-Silane** â€“ Dissolved in 95% ethanol at concentration of 10-50mg/mL

**NOTE** PEG-Silane is light sensitive, so keep in the dark.


__Protocol:__
1. Soak slides or wells with 2% hellmanex for 1 hour.
2. Wash 3x with milliQ water.
3. Soak slides in 1N NaOH for 30 minutes.
4. Wash 3x with milliQ.
5. _(Optional)_ Plasma clean 

6**a**.  If using cover slip and slide, pipette ~50-100uLs of PEG-silane solution onto slide and cover with cover slip. Let incubate in empty tip box with water in bottom overnight _(helps prevent solution from evaporating)_.   
6**b**.  If using plate format, pipette 20-50 uLs into each well, cover with parafilm, and let incubate overnight.

7. Wash 3x with millQ.

8**a**. Dry slides: If cover slip, remember which slide was peg coated, and dry in oven or with nitrogen glass.  
8**b**. Dry slides: If plate, suck out water and let sit in hood till evaporated. I bang it on a kim wipe periodically.

9. Use slides!
